This project uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to show that CMV impacts T-cell repertoire through certain biological pathways, and elucidates which of these pathways contributes to decreased mortality odds associated with T-cell repertoire. The findings on mortality are validated in an independt cohort of long-lived individuals.

**Steps involved in this project:**
1) Extract T-cell receptor (TCR) clones using MiXCR
2) Evaluate demographic differences in the clonal properties and their associations with mortality
3) Investigate whether CMV impacts T-cell repertoire
4) Use transcriptomic data to find the pathways involved
5) Identify the most influential pathway for mortality-risk
